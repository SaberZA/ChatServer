TCP Socket-based Chat Server and Client

Advanced Chat System
A demonstration of TCP communications. 
I have omitted the separation of layers to focus on the sole function of Socket-based communications.

To connect the client to the server ensure that the server is running and that the Server IP Address 
specified on the Client form is the correct destination IP Address.
